The game is currently in alpha stages. For future work, the UI would be the firt to work on with custom made asstes to make the game look and feel better. 
The second issues to be address would be the dynamic rendering to ensure that the game works on differnt resolutions and not just one.
The third issue to be address would be the educational aspect and if it feasible. This would need to be covered via user testing with kids and teacher.
